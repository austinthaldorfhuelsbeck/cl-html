                    We recognize that there is a space within us of wild and deep knowing that we have worked hard to forget.
                    It is time to welcome that knowing and all it has to tell us about who we are, and who God is, back into our bodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have known the longing for our own bodies to make space for authentic connection, incredible food,
                    and beautiful spaces in which to rest and restore what is empty and weary within us. We have tasted the
                    goodness that comes when we tend those longings.

                        hospitality, ritual, storywork and bodywork.

                            Our fall retreat invites 20 women to the richness of life between summer and winter as we harvest the
                            fruit and prepare for the dark months of winter. We will be in the beauty of the lake country in
                            Knoxville, TN and on the farm with Farm to Feast.

                            We will take a closer look at what has been brought to life, where death is lurking, what needs to be
                            harvested and what needs to be grieved.

                    <p>
                        You are invited to interrupt the heavy season of the holidays to radically embrace the fact that you need care too.
                        This advent retreat is an opportunity for you to come together in an intimate setting at a beautiful house on a lake in
                        Minneapolis where we will rest, read our bodies, and reimagine what hope, joy and peace can mean for us as we slow down,
                        feast and receive care.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        This retreat will only be 6 women, led by Tracy Johnson, Christy Bauman and Cathy Loerzel. We will be staying in an
                        incredible house together sharing meals, talking, doing some body and story work and creating space for the Spirit to
                        speak to us and for us to listen. It will be an extraordinary time to experience the coming of Emmanuel, God with us.

            <br />
            <p>
                Each of us have origin stories that shape how we operate in our day to day lives and without an understanding of these stories -
                they will subconsciously lead our lives. There are reasons we feel anxious, disconnected. depressed, sad or fearful and those
                reasons reside in your stories of childhood harm and heartache.</p><br><p>None of us can escape harm and we have all adjusted our
                ways of relating in order to negotiate the difference between what we were meant for and what we encounter. Each life can be
                understood and healed - we just have to be brave enough to listen to what our bodies know but our minds are catching up to.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                <em><strong>Storywork Intensives</strong></em> offer a space to intentionally deep dive into your stories of heartache and trauma.
                Engaging your stories will help us understand more of your family of origin and its link to where you are struggling to find freedom,
                joy and connection in the present.</p><br><p>The intensive format is intended to engage your core issues quickly, but is not intended
                to replace regular therapeutic engagement. Please ensure you have an after-care plan in place prior to the intensive. If you are in
                need of a weekly therapist, please consult
                <a href="https://adamyoungcounseling.com/referral-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Adam Young's referral list</a>

            <br />
            <p>
                Some of the most profound healing occurs in community. Storywork Group Intensives offer a chance to gather with other people and lean
                into our stories collectively as well as individually. Each person is invited to share one story and will receive engagement from me and the group.
            </p>

            <h2>Storywork Individual Intensives:</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                These intensives are designed to offer you one on one space to engage two stories with the gift of uninterrupted time. This will be a
                sacred time to focus into your past pain and begin to understand where you are stuck and how to heal from your past heartache.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                We will meet in my office in Seattle. The fee for an intensive is $3,800 for individuals and $4,200 for couples. Half of the fee is
                required as a deposit to reserve your spot.</p><br><br><p>An intensive is a significant investment so I offer a 30 minute video conference
                for us to decide if this is a good fit for you and where you are in your life. The video conference is complementary if you decide to sign up
                for an intensive.

            <h2>Storywork Body and Soul Intensives:</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                These intensives are three days in Seattle and designed to combine story and body work with the remarkable Karen Ciruli of
                <a href="https://www.bodyofeden.rest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Body of Eden.</a>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>We will conduct storywork, body sessions with Karen and end with a combined session together to help integrate the work.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
                This intensive will help us work with your whole body and help you integrate the places in your story and body that need coordinated care.
                Often our bodies are telling us a story we don't yet have words for and Karen is a skilled body practitioner who will listen to your body and
                help you connect to the unknown. That work, combined with the care of Storywork will help you heal and reconnect your body, soul and spirit.

            <p>We will meet in our offices in Seattle. The fee for an intensive is $4,500. Half of the fee is required as a deposit to reserve your spot.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
                An intensive is a significant investment so I offer a 30 minute video conference for us to decide if this is a good fit for you and where you are
                in your life. The video conference is complementary if you decide to sign up for an intensive.
